# Why Gitlab?

Former project managers:
* [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/) - used at SREd prior my arrival.
* [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/):
 * Good experience
 * Project management: wikis, issues, labels, issue's status

But, by 2013 we were needing more:

### continuous integration!

---

# But... wait!

Only you at URV - SREd?

# But... wait!

Only you at URV - SREd?

Nope... [Stack Overflow also uses Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/07/stack-overflow-support-network/)

## Gitlab: Project manager

*Everything starts with an issue*

---

## Under the hood

GitLab is a Ruby on Rails application that runs on the following software:

* Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS/RHEL
* Ruby (MRI) 2.1
* Git 2.7.4+
* Redis 2.8+
* MySQL or PostgreSQL

---

## gitlab.com for free 

- unlimited public projects
- unlimited private projects

---

## Community Edition (CE)

- Totally free
- No restrictions (10.000 projects)
- Not all features available

---

## Enterprise Edition (EE)

- gitlab.com version
- payment version
- full-featured

----

# Installation

- From source code
- From .deb .pkg packages
- From docker image

----

# Community Edition

### DIY

http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/

```
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: 9koXpg98eAheJpvBs5tK" \
    "https://my.gitlab/api/v3/projects"
```

```
curl https://my.gitlab/api/v3/user?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN
```

Or use a ruby gem [gitlab - Dec 2015](https://rubygems.org/gems/gitlab/versions/3.6.1) | [github](https://github.com/NARKOZ/gitlab)

;-)

## Merge requests are powerful

![Merge request](images/merge-request-header.png)

---

### Discussion section

* For any comment on the `Changes` section, **ideal for peer-review**
* Any push on the source branch is also presented
* General comments

![Discussion](images/merge-request-status.png)

---

### Commits on the merge request

![Commits on the merge request](images/merge-request-commits.png)

---

### Builds on the merge request

![Builds on the merge request](images/merge-request-builds.png)

With code coverage if enabled!

### Presenting code differences

# But only a project manager?

----

# Continuous Integration

- Gitlab CI integrated with Gitlab
- Per project
- Every push\* produces a build

http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/README.html

## List of builds

![List of builds](images/build-list.png)

## A single build

## Enabling code coverage

# But... How?

A simple keyword

## runners

---

## A runner is

- a Gitlab's [registered client](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/runners/README.html)
- [installed on any computer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/#install-gitlab-runner)

![Gitlab Runner Instllation](images/gitlabcirunner-installation.png)

---

## A runner waits for

- requests from Gitlab to run tasks
 * unitary tests
 * integration tests
 * ...
 * whatever defined in *.gitlab-ci.yml* file.

---

## .gitlab-ci.yml

```
# This file is generated by GitLab CI
Moodle CI Test:
  script:
  - composer self-update
  - composer install
  - ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c tests/ --coverage-text --colors=never
  tags:
  except:
  - tags
```

Features:
* Different build tasks for different code versions
* Stages (dev, pre-prod, prod)
* Different tasks/tests/actions per stage

---

### Runners are integrated from Gitlab

- Gitlab shows whether it was ok
- Rerun build on demand
- Depicts which computer is committing the build

![Build header](images/build-header.png)

---

## When installing a runner

You decide the execution type of builds

- shell
- docker
- docker-ssh
- ssh

---

## Runner types

### Shared

- Proceeding builds from any project (default)
- Tags to describe requirements (project vs. runner tags)

### Specific

- You manually assign runners to projects

# Demo time!

Note:
- docker start gitlab
- root / 5iveL!fe
- git clone ssh://git@192.168.1.2:8022/root/demo.git

----

# So...

1. **Gitlab** as a project manager (Gitlab + Gitlab CI)
2. With **continuous integration** (spotted everywhere)
3. Connected to **runners** to do automated tasks execution
