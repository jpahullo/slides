# But... How?

A simple keyword

**runners**

---

# A runner is

- a Gitlab's [registered client](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/runners/README.html)
- [installed on any computer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/#install-gitlab-runner)

image of types of installations

---

# A runner waits

- requests from Gitlab to run tasks
 * unitary tests
 * integration tests
 * ...
 * whatever defined in *.gitlab-ci.yml* file.

---

# Runners are integrated from Gitlab

- Gitlab shows whether it was ok
- Rerun build on demand
- Depicts which computer is committing the build

---

# When installing a runner

You decide the execution type of builds

- shell
- docker
- docker-ssh
- ssh

---

# Runner types

### Shared

- Proceeding builds from any project (default)
- Use tags to describe requirements

### Specific

- You manually assign runners to projects

----

# Demo

# Thanks!
