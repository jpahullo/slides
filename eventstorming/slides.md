# Why
# Event Storming?

----

# Product Requirements

---

Assume you have to build a new software

---

How do you collect the requirements?

---

How long it takes? Weeks? Months?

---

What if #?&ÑqwY%$"@ ?

---

Surrounding a table?

---

Dealing with personal positions?

----

# Key question

Collecting and building a set of requirements<br>
is a learning process?

----

# Why not... 
# "Let's Play!"

Human beings _**learn**_ more quickly while

playing and redoing things. 

---

## Set the requirements
# in hours 
## instead of months?

----

## Let's do
# event storming

----

# Steps for event storming

1. Prepare the room (preferably empty room)
1. Put the paper roll fixed on the wall: 20-30 minutes
1. Give a pen to every participant: 5-10 minutes
1. Introduce the "game rules": 15-25 minutes
1. Let's play! (by hours)

---

## Introduce simple,
# game rules

1. Stickers and colours
1. Working in rounds (pomodoro style)
1. Prevent* long-term discussions

----

# As a participant

Let's keep ... !

* Open-minded
* Focused
* Analytical
* Deliberative
* Proactive

---

# As a participant

You will learn! 100% sure!

----

# As a facilitator

* Hard worker

---

# The facilitator

* Who? Anyone (What? *)
    * Self-learned (make retrospective meetings)
    * Taught on facilitating event storming
* Expert on the domain? 
    * Not necessary to know anything about the context

---

## Facilitator tasks (1/3)

Make the learning process work

First conquer, then divide

---

## Facilitator tasks (2/3)

Manage time!

25 minutes for play
5 minutes for retrospective

---

## Facilitator tasks (3/3)

Make participants keeping ...!

* Focused
* Analytical
* Deliberative
* Proactive

----

## Tips for facilitators

---

When discussions appear among participants:

* Let them time for a while, consider productivity
* No more than 5-10 minutes a group discussing
* A blocking discussion? 
   * Stop it!
   * Delegate a proposal on a participant
   * Propose divide the problem being discussed
* Knowledge-building discussion?
   * It's OK!

---

Look at body language. Promote active attitude.

* Motivate opening new kind of events
* Motivate diving into a part of the problem
* Make them think about events time line
* Sitting down is not a problem. Changing viewpoint?

Keep ALL participants in play

---

Make questions

Do not give solutions

---

Implicit knowledge have to be **explicit**

---

Focus on the core of the problem 

(your domain on DDD)

---

Build an ubiquitous language (DDD)

---

# Relationships with...

**DDD**: Domain-Driven Desing

**CQRS / ES**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation/Event Sourcing
