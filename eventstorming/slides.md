# Key question

---

Collecting and building a set of requirements<br>
is a **learning process**?

learn how to learn."<br><br>

# As a participant

Let's keep ... !

* Open-minded
* Focused
* Analytical
* Deliberative
* Proactive

---

# As a participant

You will learn! 100% sure!

----

# As a facilitator

* Hard worker

---

# The facilitator

* Who? Anyone (What? *)
    * Self-learned (make retrospective meetings)
    * Taught on facilitating event storming
* Expert on the domain? 
    * Not necessary to know anything about the context

---

## Facilitator tasks (1/3)

Make the learning process work

First conquer, then divide

---

## Facilitator tasks (2/3)

Manage time!

25 minutes for play
5 minutes for retrospective

---

## Facilitator tasks (3/3)

Make participants keeping ...!

* Focused
* Analytical
* Deliberative
* Proactive

----

## Tips for facilitators

---

When discussions appear among participants:

* Let them time for a while, consider productivity
* No more than 5-10 minutes a group discussing
* A blocking discussion? 
   * Stop it!
   * Delegate a proposal on a participant
   * Propose divide the problem being discussed
* Knowledge-building discussion?
   * It's OK!

---

Look at body language. Promote active attitude.

* Motivate opening new kind of events
* Motivate diving into a part of the problem
* Make them think about events time line
* Sitting down is not a problem. Changing viewpoint?

Keep ALL participants in play

---

Make questions

Do not give solutions

---

Implicit knowledge have to be **explicit**

---

Focus on the core of the problem 

(your domain on DDD)

---

Build an ubiquitous language (DDD)

---

# Relationships with...

**DDD**: Domain-Driven Desing

**CQRS / ES**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation/Event Sourcing
