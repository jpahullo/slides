# Gitlab slides

These slides were prepared for the [Tarragona Developer Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tarragona-Developers-Meetup/events/229781981/) to present [Gitlab](http://www.gitlab.com).

Gitlab is a project management tool (like github), but with continious integration included, all-in-one.

# Slides technology

These slides were elaborated with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), 
a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. 
[Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

To preview content you can clone this project and simply follow these steps:

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ grunt serve
   ```

2. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `grunt serve --port 8001`.
